            <p className="about">Hi, I'm Bessy!<br></br>
            Last year, I made a bold decision and decided to switch career paths and try to break into the tech industry.<br></br>
            Since then, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp, which I completed at the end of July 2021.<br></br>
            I am now on the job hunt! While I enjoyed diving into both stacks, I found my love for frontend development.<br></br>
            I love the process of seeing a blank page turn into something beautiful. Hang with me as I go on this quest to figure frontend development out!<br></br>Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email at bmendoza329@hotmail.com. You can also find me on Dev! </p>
            <p className="likes">LIKES: everything frontend, horror movies, rollerskating, design, plants,traveling, and my pup</p><br></br> 
            <p className="dislikes">DISLIKES: backend development, coding bugs, actual bugs </p>
